# functional-kotlin

This repo will be used to track and work through the `Functional Kotlin` book by Mario Arias and 
Rivu Chakraborty published by Packt. 

The `Arrow` library will be used to supplement the out-of-the-box functional capabilities of the core Kotlin language.

Ideally, there will be exercises and that can be derived and used for Katas or a workshop on using the functional paradigm
in Kotlin.
